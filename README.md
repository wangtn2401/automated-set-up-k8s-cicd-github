## This script does the following:

* This script will run on Ubuntu

1 - Installs Docker, which is required to run a Kubernetes cluster.

2- Installs kubectl, which is the command-line tool used to interact with Kubernetes clusters.

3 - Installs minikube, which is a tool used to run a local Kubernetes cluster for testing and development.

4 - Starts the minikube cluster.

5 - Creates a Kubernetes secret named github-secret that stores the GitHub token required to connect to GitHub CI/CD.

Note that you will need to configure your GitHub repository with a GitHub token and use it to authenticate your Kubernetes cluster with GitHub CI/CD. This script assumes that you have already set up a GitHub token and added it to your repository's secrets. In the script, ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} retrieves the GitHub token from the repository's secrets. You will also need to modify your GitHub Actions workflow to use this token for authentication.
